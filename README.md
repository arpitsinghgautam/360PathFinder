# 360PathFinder 🌐

360PathFinder is a real-time pathfinding algorithm designed specifically for 360-degree image analysis. It takes as input a panoramic image and identifies optimal paths from a given starting point to a designated destination within the image. By leveraging advanced image processing techniques and graph-based algorithms, 360PathFinder offers users a seamless and intuitive way to navigate through immersive visual environments.

## Inspiration 💡
My inspiration for 360PathFinder stemmed from the need for efficient pathfinding solutions in 360-degree environments. I was intrigued by the challenges posed in navigating complex spatial layouts captured in panoramic images and sought to develop a solution that could facilitate efficient route planning in such environments. The spark for this project ignited during the 418 Hackathon, where I encountered the problem statement addressing the complexities of pathfinding in immersive visual environments. I found the problem statement to be very interesting and saw it as an opportunity to delve into the realm of panoramic image analysis and develop a novel solution to address this challenge.
